            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Nik Abdul Aziz was born in Kota Bharu in 1931 as the second of five siblings. He was
                 raised by a single father (Tok Kura) who was an aspiring blacksmith. Nik Aziz's Islamic
                  studies began in pondok schools in Kelantan and Terengganu. He went on to study at Darul
                   Uloom Deoband in Uttar Pradesh, India for five years. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in
                    Arabic Studies and Master of Arts in Islamic jurisprudence from Al-Azhar University, Egypt.
                     During his university studies, he was one of the witnesses and a civilian to have lived in
                      the heat of the Arab-Israeli Conflict. Having returned from Egypt, Nik Aziz began as a
                       teacher at various religious schools in Kelantan, hence his popular nickname "Tok Guru."</p>
